# A Comparison Study on Machine Learning Algorithms and Data Mining Techniques

The purpose of the study is to evaluate, compare and discuss the results and insights gained from exploring
different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms as well as Data Mining (DM) techniques. Therefore, this report
is about exploring different algorithms belonging to Classification, Regression and Clustering problem types.
The basic design of the study includes Data Preparation and Understanding, Data Pre-Processing, Modelling,
Parameter Tuning, Evaluating the models within and against two datasets. One of the major findings is that
an algorithm performing well on one dataset need not necessarily perform well on the other dataset. Overall,
on two different datasets, the performances of algorithms were evaluated based on their performance metrics,
interpretability, interestingness and their ability to generalize on unseen data.

# A Comparison Study on Machine Learning Algorithms and Data Mining Techniques

The purpose of this study is to evaluate, compare and discuss the results and insights gained from exploring
different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms as well as Data Mining (DM) techniques. Thus, this report
explores in depth of the following algorithms: Classification, Regression and Clustering problem types.
This report is divided into five section: Data Preparation and Understanding, Data Pre-Processing, Modelling,
Parameter Tuning, Evaluating the models within and against two datasets. The performance of algorithms were evaluated based on their performance metrics,interpretability, interestingness and their ability to generalize on unseen data.
